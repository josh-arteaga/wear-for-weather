I am using ChatGPT to structure the development phases of this plan. 

Had an issue getting the project initialized and the FastAPI server started. Used ChatGPT to help me out. I was admittedly "up a level" in my terminal window and had my venv stored a level up as well.

Fleshed out the weather and Ollama clients with ChatGPT's help generating and Copilot explaining parts I wasn't 100 on

Found out about JavaScript's Geolocation API for the frontend to send user geolocation data to FastAPI backend
Need to add this frontend logic in my very basic HTML file.
